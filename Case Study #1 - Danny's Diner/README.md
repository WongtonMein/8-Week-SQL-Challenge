# Questions and Solutions

Feel free to join me in writing and executing queries using PostgreSQL in [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138). 

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT
  sales.customer_id,
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
Steps Taken:
- Select the customer_id and SUM the total amount spent per customer
- Combine the Sales and Menu tables using a JOIN on their respective product_id values
- The SUM (or aggregated) results are then grouped by customer_id using the GROUP BY function

Results:
| customer_id | total_amount_spent |
|---|---|
| A | 76 |
| B | 74 |
| C | 36 |
